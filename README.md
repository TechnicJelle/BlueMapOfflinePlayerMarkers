Adds markers in the positions where players have logged off to [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap).

Compatible with Paper 1.13+, just like BlueMap itself.

To reload this plugin, just reload BlueMap itself with `/bluemap reload`.

If you want specific players to not get offline markers, you can hide them from BlueMap
by using a plugin like [BlueMapPlayerControl](https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapPlayerControl) (also by me).

By default, banned players also don't show up. You can change this in the config, though.

If you want to permanently hide a player from the map, you can also just delete their playerdata file from your server.
