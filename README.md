Compatible with Paper 1.13+, just like BlueMap itself.

To reload this plugin, just reload BlueMap itself with `/bluemap reload`.

If you want specific players to not get offline markers, you can hide them from BlueMap
by using a plugin like [BlueMapPlayerControl](https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapPlayerControl) (also by me).

For a Fabric port of this plugin, please see [this fork by syorito-hatsuki](https://github.com/syorito-hatsuki/BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkersFabric)
